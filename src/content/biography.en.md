From a young age my interests revolved around mathematics, computers, cars, music and Japanese culture.

I decided to study the science of mathematics and taught myself programming along the way. I believe in the well-known phrase "the work you do in your spare time is the work you should do all your life." I've been building web applications since 2020, and started my professional career in February 2023.

In that time, I have learned Python, C, C++ and Rust on an amateur level.
