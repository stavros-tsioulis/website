# A Creative Agency's landing page

The Provollee team had just put themselves into the web and e-shop building scene, and needed a simple and direct landing page.
The site is no longer accessible, however, as the owners have changed their focus to other markets.

## Tech stack
React, Tailwind, Framer Motion.

## Skills nurtured
- First professional experience using React and Tailwind;
- [Framer Motion](https://github.com/framer/motion): Animation orchetration for the Hero content;
- Devops: The website was hosted manually on a dedicated server. I managed certificates using letsencrypt, and configured a reverse proxy using HAProxy to inject the certificate to the response headers, and then worked with Cloudflare Tunnels to proxy traffic securely to the server.
