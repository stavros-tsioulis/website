# Simple. Straightforward landing page for a Creative Agency.

The first partnership was simple. The Provollee team had just put themselves into the web and e-shop building scene, and needed a simple and direct landing page.

- To ensure the smooth running of the site\'s lightweight animations, we chose the React framework in order to take advantage of the excellent framer-motion library.
- In order to prepare the website for the future, the necessary anti-DDoS, caching, and metrics tools were prepared so as to provide immediate information about the state of the servers to admins.

The site is no longer accessible, however, as the owners have changed their focus to other markets.
